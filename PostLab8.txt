1. We used 5 for Ki and 3 for Kp. Increasing the constants too much makes the change much faster, but also makes a larger oscillation. We decided on the values we did because the change in speed was quick with minimal oscillation. 

2.  Good -- Improved control loop performance, 
	Bad -- Wear and tear due to noise, makes tuning more difficult
	
3.  Improper Tuning
		Use tools to see response, test different values
    Under Filtering
		Use tools to see if not enough noise is being filtered, increase filter appropriately.
		If not feasible, consider removing derivative term from PID algorithm
	Wrong Algorithm
		Sometimes a more complex PID algorithm should be used for specialized systems, or a simpler
		one should be used if a complex one is not suited to the problem
	Over Filtering
		Use tools to see if signal is being dampened due to excessive filtering, lessen filter
